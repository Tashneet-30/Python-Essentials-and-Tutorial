Then Let's start with the basic ### DATA TYPES first :
1. Integer : Refers to any number (negative,positive)
For eg: 1,-5,98

2.String : (str) Anything embedded in quotations 
For eg : 'tashneet','school'
Also, if a number is enclosed like this '234' , It Behaves as a String.However, does not matter if quotations are Single or Double

3.Bool : True and False 

4.Float : Decimal Number with a floating Type
For eg : 0.765,9.8765

How to create  a VARIABLE :
type name of a variable and then assign the value : 
For eg : x='tshnt'
And if you wish to print the value :
    print(x)
You can even change the value of x again 

#### Variables names can only contain underscores and english alphabets and cannot start with numbers 
and X and x are not similar in Python

### To get INPUT from the user :
    x = input()
    print(x)
print("Hey..",Enter your age)
age = input()
print("Her Age ",age)

## OPERATORS : +,-,*,/ (to perform mathematical operations and calculations)
For eg;
a= 8
b = 9
print(a+b) etc etc.
### Exponents in Python : **
// --> returns the quotient 
% -->   returns the remainder 

### Decision Statement ::
IF/ELIF/ELSE
if condition=True:
   do this 
else:
   do this
   
### NOTE : HERE, INDENTATION SHOULD BE PROPER...!!!

x= int(input())
if x>9:
   print("Hey")
elif x>18:
   print("YOYO")
else:
   print("Done")
   
   
   
### CHAINED CONDITIONALS ::
adding multiple conditionals 

if x==y and x+y==5:
   do this 
   
   
and :: both conditions on either side must be true 
Similarly, or keyword :: either of the condition should be true 
 not :: replaces anything i.e. TRUE becomes FALSE and vice versa
 
 ## NESTED IF STATEMENTS :: 
 if condtn:
   if condtn:
   else:
 else:
 
 
## LOOPS ::
